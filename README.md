This is my project for the CDL Kata

It is completely re-usable and all you have to do to add items and deals is to add them to the data array in the "data.tsx" file. No need to actually change any code

With more time i would make the styling responsive to be able to be viewed on any screen size.

I would also add in the functionality described inside the prices file on line 7
